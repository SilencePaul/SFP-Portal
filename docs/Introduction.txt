Team 22 developed the Save Fur Pets (SFP) Animal Management System, a cloud-native platform that streamlines the end-to-end animal adoption workflow for a volunteer-run rescue organization. The system supports fosters, coordinators, interviewers, and applicants by centralizing animal profiles, applications, interview scheduling, and contract management. Key features include a stateful PostgreSQL database with persistent storage and automated email notifications powered by SendGrid. The application runs as containerized services orchestrated through Kubernetes on DigitalOcean, using Redis for caching and Prometheus-compatible metrics for observability. The goal is to provide a secure and efficient adoption experience.
